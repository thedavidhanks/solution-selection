Globus,"​Globus is a non-profit service for secure, reliable research data management. With Globus, users can move, share, & discover data via a single interface--whether your files live on a supercomputer, lab cluster, tape archive, public cloud or your laptop, you can manage this data from anywhere, using your existing identities, via just a web browser.​ Developers can also use Globus to build applications and gateways leveraging its advanced identity management, single sign-on, search, authorization, and automation capabilities.","Data collected from instruments (e.g., cryoEM, gene sequencers, remote sensors) can be transferred from the data collection point to a centralized storage resource, like SDSC or the cloud. From there, the data can be processed for analysis or shared with external collaborators.","UCSD has a subscription that covers all community members, including staff and students. UCSD research projects operating Globus Connect Server endpoints can add them to the subscription to unlock additional features, including guest collections to enable access by external collaborators. Individual researchers can join the UCSD Globus Plus Group to create guest collections on their Globus Connect Personal endpoints. Our subscription also includes connectors for Amazon Web Services S3 cloud storage and Google Drive.

 

For projects handling protected information--Protected Health Information (PHI), Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and controlled-but-unclassified (CUI) data--our subscription covers the Globus High Assurance features, and includes a Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Because Globus Connect endpoints are operated by the data owners (i.e, a user, research project, or data center) there may be substantial additional work to ensure the endpoint is secure.","Globus does not store data, it is a service that provides reliable and secure data transfers between endpoints. The endpoints are operated by users, projects, and data centers, and endpoint capacity is based on the storage it accesses. For example, if you have a Globus Connect Personal endpoint on your laptop, the maximum capacity is the free space on your laptop. However, if you’re using the AWS S3 connector, the limiting factor is probably your budget. There are some limitations in the number of transfers and permissions.","Data access can be set up for only users on a system, or for sharing using a collaborators’s outside identity (i.e., from another university or ORCiD). These permissions are set on the folder level and managing access can be granted to users through roles.","Our subscription covers the Globus High Assurance features, and includes a Business Associate Agreement (BAA).

Because Globus Connect endpoints are operated by the data owners (i.e, a user, research project, or data center) there may be substantial additional work to ensure the endpoint is secure.","Like capacity, the durability of data accessible via Globus depends on the underlying endpoint and its storage. However, Globus provides several mechanisms to ensure data integrity during and after transfer. The first is the reliability of the transfer. Globus will retry transfers when the source or destination endpoint, or the network between them, suffers an outage. Second, Globus can use checksums to verify the integrity of the transferred files. With the ability to schedule recurring transfers, Globus can also be used as a reliable tool for data replication between systems.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE
